Tutorial 5 - Taking it mobile: Android
======================================

Now, we're going to take our application, and deploy it as an Android
application.

The process of deploying an application to Android is very similar to the
process for deploying as a desktop application. Briefcase handles installing
dependencies for Android, including the Android SDK, the Android emulator, and
a Java compiler.

Create an Android app and compile it
====================================

First, run the ``create`` command. This downloads an Android app template and
adds your Python code to it.

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: bash

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase create android

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: doscon

      (beeware-venv) C:\...>briefcase create android

      ...
      [helloworld] Installing application code...
      ...
      [helloworld] Installing application resources...
      ...
      [helloworld] Application created.

When you run ``briefcase create android`` for the first time, Briefcase
downloads a Java JDK, and the Android SDK. File sizes and download times can be
considerable; this may take a while (10 minutes or longer, depending on the
speed of your Internet connection). When the download has completed, you will
be prompted to accept Google's Android SDK license.

Once this completes, we'll now have an ``android`` directory in our project.
This directory will contain a ``Hello World`` folder, which will contain an
Android project with a Gradle build configuration. This project will contain
your application code, and a support package containing the Python interpreter.

We can then use Briefcase's ``build`` command to compile this into an Android
APK app file.

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: bash

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase build android
      [helloworld] Building Android APK...
      Starting a Gradle Daemon
      ...
      BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 1s
      28 actionable tasks: 17 executed, 11 up-to-date
      [helloworld] Built android/Hello World/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: bash

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase build android
      [helloworld] Building Android APK...
      Starting a Gradle Daemon
      ...
      BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 1s
      28 actionable tasks: 17 executed, 11 up-to-date
      [helloworld] Built android/Hello World/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: doscon

      (beeware-venv) C:\...>briefcase build android
      [helloworld] Building Android APK...
      Starting a Gradle Daemon
      ...
      BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 1s
      28 actionable tasks: 17 executed, 11 up-to-date
      [helloworld] Built android\Hello World\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk

.. admonition:: Gradle may look stuck

  During the ``briefcase build android`` step, Gradle (the Android platform
  build tool) will print ``CONFIGURING: 100%``, and appear to be doing nothing.
  Don't worry, it's not stuck - it's downloading more Android SDK components.
  Depending on your Internet connection speed, this may take another 10 minutes
  (or longer). This lag should only happen the very first time you run
  ``build``; the tools are cached, and on your next build, the cached versions
  will be used.

Run the app on a virtual device
===============================

We're now ready to run our application. You can use Briefcase's ``run`` command
to run the app on an Android device. Let's start by running on an Android
emulator.

To run your application, run ``briefcase run android``. When you do this,
you'll be prompted with a list of devices that you could run the app on. The
last item will always be an option to create a new Android emulator.

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: bash

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase run android

      Select device:

        1) Create a new Android emulator

      >

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: bash

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase run android

      Select device:

        1) Create a new Android emulator

      >

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: doscon

      (beeware-venv) C:\...>briefcase run android

      Select device:

        1) Create a new Android emulator

      >

We can now choose our desired device. Select the "Create a new Android
emulator" option, and accept the default choice for the device name
(``beePhone``).

Briefcase ``run`` will automatically boot the virtual device. When the device
is booting, you will see the Android logo:

.. figure:: ../images/android/tutorial-5-booting.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30%
   :alt: Android virtual device booting

   Android virtual device booting

Once the device has finished booting, Briefcase will install your app on the
device. You will briefly see a launcher screen:

.. figure:: ../images/android/tutorial-5-running.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30%
   :alt: Android virtual device fully started, on the launcher screen

   Android virtual device fully started, on the launcher screen

The app will then start. You'll see a splash screen while the app starts up:

.. figure:: ../images/android/tutorial-5-splash.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30%
   :alt: App splash screen

   App splash screen

The first time the app starts, it needs to unpack itself onto the device. This
may take a few seconds. Once it's unpacked, you'll see the Android version of
our desktop app:

.. figure:: ../images/android/tutorial-5-launched.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30%
   :alt: App from Tutorial 2, fully launched

   Demo app fully launched

If you fail to see your app launching, you may need to check your terminal
where you ran ``briefcase run`` and look for any error messages.

In future, if you want to run on this device without using the menu, you can
provide the emulator's name to Briefcase, using ``briefcase run android -d
@beePhone`` to run on the virtual device directly.

Run the app on a physical device
================================

If you have a physical Android phone or tablet, you can connect it to your
computer with a USB cable, and then use the Briefcase to target your physical
device.

If Briefcase can detect the device, it will appear in the ``run`` output. The
first time you use a device for development, it may report itself as an
"Unknown device (not authorized for development)":

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: bash

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase run android

      Select device:

        1) Unknown device (not authorized for development) (94ZZY0LNE8)
        2) @beePhone (emulator)
        3) Create a new Android emulator

      >

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: bash

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase run android

      Select device:

        1) Unknown device (not authorized for development) (94ZZY0LNE8)
        2) @beePhone (emulator)
        3) Create a new Android emulator

      >

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: doscon

      (beeware-venv) C:\...>briefcase run android

      Select device:

        1) Unknown device (not authorized for development) (94ZZY0LNE8)
        2) @beePhone (emulator)
        3) Create a new Android emulator

      >

Android requires that devices be placed into "developer" mode before you can
load an app onto the device. Select the "unknown" device, and you'll be shown
a link that shows you how to enable developer mode.

Once developer mode has been enabled you can re-run ``briefcase run android``:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: bash

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase run android

      Select device:

        1) Pixel 3a (94ZZY0LNE8)
        2) @beePhone (emulator)
        3) Create a new Android emulator

      >

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: bash

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase run android

      Select device:

        1) Pixel 3a (94ZZY0LNE8)
        2) @beePhone (emulator)
        3) Create a new Android emulator

      >

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: doscon

      (beeware-venv) C:\...>briefcase run android

      Select device:

        1) Pixel 3a (94ZZY0LNE8)
        2) @beePhone (emulator)
        3) Create a new Android emulator

      >

This time, we get the name of the device, and it's serial number (in this case,
a Pixel 3a).

In the future, if you want to run on this device without using the menu, you can
provide the phones's serial number to Briefcase, using ``briefcase run android
-d 94ZZY0LNE8``. Thi will run on the device directly, wthout prompting.

.. note::

    When youâ€™re developing for Android, it's useful to be able to view the
    Android logs. To view the Android logs without the background noise from
    the rest of the system, you can run ``adb logcat -s MainActivity:* stdio:*
    Python:*``. Anything your app writes to stdout (e.g., the output of
    ``print()`` statements) will be visible in the logs.
