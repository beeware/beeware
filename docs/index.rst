Welcome to the BeeWare Tutorial!
================================

**Write Python. Run Anywhere.**

Welcome to BeeWare! In this tutorial, we're going to build a graphical user interface
using Python, and deploy it as a desktop application, as a mobile application, and as a
single page web app. We'll also look at how you can use BeeWare tools to perform some of
the common tasks that you'll need to do as an app developer, such as testing your app.

.. only:: machine_translation

   .. admonition:: This is a machine translation!

      This version of the tutorial has been generated by machine translation. We know this
      isn't ideal, but we felt that a bad translation was better than no translation at
      all.

      If you'd like the help improve the translation, get in touch! We have a
      ``#translations`` channel in `Discord <https://beeware.org/bee/chat/>`__.
      Introduce yourself there and we will add you to the translation team.

.. only:: human_translation

   .. admonition:: This is a translation!

      This document is a translation of the English version. The translation has been
      reviewed by humans, but newer sections may be generated by machine translation, or
      not translated at all.

      If you'd like the help improve the translation, get in touch! We have a
      ``#translations`` channel in `Discord <https://beeware.org/bee/chat/>`__.

What is BeeWare?
================

BeeWare is not a single product, or tool, or library - it's a collection of tools and
libraries, each of which works together to help you write cross platform Python
applications with a native GUI. It includes:

* `Toga <https://toga.readthedocs.io>`__, a cross platform widget toolkit;
* `Briefcase <https://briefcase.readthedocs.io>`__, a tool for packaging Python
  projects as distributable artefacts that can be shipped to end users;
* Libraries (such as `Rubicon ObjC <https://rubicon-objc.readthedocs.io>`__) for
  accessing platform-native libraries;
* Pre-compiled builds of Python that can be used on platforms where official
  Python installers aren't available.

In this tutorial, we'll be using all these tools, but as a user, you'll only need to
interact with the first two (Toga and Briefcase). However, each of the tools can also be
used individually - for example, you can use Briefcase to deploy an app without using
Toga as a GUI toolkit.

The BeeWare suite is available on macOS, Windows, Linux (using GTK); on mobile
platforms such as Android and iOS; and for the Web.

Lets go!
