Tutorial 1 - Your first app
===========================

We're ready to create our first application.

Install the BeeWare tools
=========================

First, we need to install **Briefcase**. Briefcase is a BeeWare tool that can
be used to package your application for distribution to end users - but it can
also be used to bootstrap a new project. Make sure you're in the
``beeware-tutorial`` directory you created in :doc:`Tutorial 0 <tutorial-0>`,
with the ``beeware-venv`` virtual environment activated, and run:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      (beeware-venv) $ python -m pip install briefcase

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      (beeware-venv) $ python -m pip install briefcase

    .. admonition:: Possible errors during installation

        If you see errors during installation, it's almost certainly because
        some of the system requirements haven't been installed. Make sure you
        have :ref:`installed all the platform pre-requisites
        <install-dependencies>`.

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: doscon

      (beeware-venv) C:\...>python -m pip install briefcase

    .. admonition:: Possible errors during installation

        It is important that you use ``python -m pip``, rather than a bare ``pip``.
        Briefcase needs to ensure that it has an up-to-date version of ``pip`` and
        ``setuptools``, and a bare invocation of ``pip`` can't self-update. If you
        want to know more, `Brett Cannon has a detailed blog post about the issue
        <https://snarky.ca/why-you-should-use-python-m-pip/>`__.

Bootstrap a new project
=======================

Let's start our first BeeWare project!  We're going to use the Briefcase
``new`` command to create an application called **Hello World**. Run the
following from your command prompt:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase new

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase new

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: doscon

      (beeware-venv) C:\...>briefcase new

Briefcase will ask us for some details of our new application. For the
purposes of this tutorial, use the following:

* **Formal Name** - Accept the default value: ``Hello World``.

* **App Name** - Accept the default value: ``helloworld``.

* **Bundle** - If you own your own domain, enter that domain in reversed order.
  (For example, if you own the domain "cupcakes.com", enter ``com.cupcakes``
  as the bundle). If you don't own your own domain, accept the default bundle
  (``com.example``).

* **Project Name** - Accept the default value: ``Hello World``.

* **Description** - Accept the default value (or, if you want to be really
  creative, come up with your own description!)

* **Author** - Enter your own name here.

* **Author's email** - Enter your own email address. This will be used in the
  configuration file, in help text, and anywhere that an email is required
  when submitting the app to an app store.

* **URL** - The URL of the landing page for your application. Again, if you own
  your own domain, enter a URL at that domain (including the ``https://``).
  Otherwise, just accept the default URL (``https://example.com/helloworld``).
  This URL doesn't need to actually exist (for now); it will only be used if
  you publish your application to an app store.

* **License** - Accept the default license (BSD). This won't affect
  anything about the operation of the tutorial, though - so if you have
  particularly strong feelings about license choice, feel free to choose
  another license.

* **GUI framework** - Accept the default option, Toga (BeeWare's own GUI
  toolkit).

Briefcase will then generate a project skeleton for you to use. If you've
followed this tutorial so far, and accepted the defaults as described, your
file system should look something like::

    beeware-tutorial/
    ├── beeware-venv/
    │   └── ...
    └── helloworld/
        ├── CHANGELOG
        ├── LICENSE
        ├── pyproject.toml
        ├── README.rst
        ├── src/
        │   └── helloworld/
        │       ├── app.py
        │       ├── __init__.py
        │       ├── __main__.py
        │       └── resources/
        │           └── README
        └── tests/
            ├── helloworld.py
            ├── __init__.py
            └── test_app.py

This skeleton is actually a fully functioning application without adding
anything else. The ``src`` folder contains all the code for the application, the
``tests`` folder contains an initial test suite, and the ``pyproject.toml`` file
describes how to package the application for distribution. If you open
``pyproject.toml`` in an editor, you'll see the configuration details you just
provided to Briefcase.

Now that we have a stub application, we can use Briefcase to run the
application.

Run the app in developer mode
=============================

Move into the ``helloworld`` project directory and tell briefcase to start
the project in Developer (or ``dev``) mode:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      (beeware-venv) $ cd helloworld
      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase dev

      [hello-world] Installing requirements...
      ...

      [helloworld] Starting in dev mode...
      ===========================================================================

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      (beeware-venv) $ cd helloworld
      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase dev

      [hello-world] Installing requirements...
      ...

      [helloworld] Starting in dev mode...
      ===========================================================================

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: doscon

      (beeware-venv) C:\...>cd helloworld
      (beeware-venv) C:\...>briefcase dev

      [hello-world] Installing requirements...
      ...

      [helloworld] Starting in dev mode...
      ===========================================================================

This should open a GUI window:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. image:: images/macOS/tutorial-1.png
       :align: center
       :alt: Hello World Tutorial 1 window, on macOS

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. image:: images/linux/tutorial-1.png
       :align: center
       :alt: Hello World Tutorial 1 window, on Linux

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. image:: images/windows/tutorial-1.png
       :align: center
       :alt: Hello World Tutorial 1 window, on Windows

    .. admonition:: Invalid requirements or pip unable to connect

      If you encounter the error:

      .. code-block:: doscon

        Unable to install requirements. This may be because one of your
        requirements is invalid, or because pip was unable to connect
        to the PyPI server.

      Confirm that you are running a :ref:`version of python that this tutorial supports
      <install-python>`.

      If your version of python is *not* a supported version, you will have to restart
      the tutorial.

Press the close button (or select Quit from the application's menu), and you're
done! Congratulations - you've just written a standalone, native application
in Python!

Next steps
==========

We now have a working application, running in developer mode. Now we can add
some logic of our own to make our application do something a little more
interesting. In :doc:`Tutorial 2 <tutorial-2>`, we'll put a more useful user
interface onto our application.
