==================================
Tutorial 2 - Making it interesting
==================================

In :doc:`Tutorial 1 <tutorial-1>`, we generated a stub project that was able
to run, but we didn't write any code ourselves. Let's take a look at what was
generated for us.

What was generated
==================

In the ``src/helloworld`` directory, you should see 3 files: ``__init__.py``,
``__main__.py`` and ``app.py``.

``__init__.py`` marks the ``helloworld`` directory as an importable Python
module. It is an empty file; the very fact it exists tells the Python
interpreter that the ``helloworld`` directory defines a module.

``__main__.py`` marks the ``helloworld`` module as a special kind of module -
an executable module. If you try to run the ``helloworld`` module using
``python -m helloworld``, the ``__main__.py`` file is where Python will start
executing. The contents of ``__main__.py`` is relatively simple::

    from helloworld.app import main

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main().main_loop()

This file does two things:

* It imports the ``main`` method from from the ``helloworld`` app.
* Then, it starts the applicationâ€™s main loop. The main loop is the way a GUI
  application listens for user input (like mouse clicks and keyboard presses).

The more interesting file is ``app.py`` - this contains the logic that creates
our application window::

    import toga
    from toga.style.pack import COLUMN, ROW

    class HelloWorld(toga.App):
        def startup(self):
            main_box = toga.Box()

            self.main_window = toga.MainWindow(title=self.formal_name)
            self.main_window.content = main_box
            self.main_window.show()

    def main():
        return HelloWorld()

Let's go through this line by line::

    import toga
    from toga.style.pack import COLUMN, ROW

First, we import the ``toga`` widget toolkit, as well as some style-related
utility constants. Our code doesn't use these yet - but we'll make
use of them shortly.

Then, we define a class::

    class HelloWorld(toga.App):

Each Toga application has a single ``toga.App`` instance, representing the
running entity that is the application. The app may end up managing multiple
windows; but for simple applications, there will be a single main window.

Next, we define a ``startup()`` method::

        def startup(self):
            main_box = toga.Box()

The first thing the startup method does is to define a main box. Toga's layout
scheme behaves similar to HTML. You build an application by constructing a
collection of boxes, each of which contains other boxes, or actual widgets. You
then apply styles to these boxes to define how they will consume the available
window space.

In this application, we define a single box, but we don't put anything into it.

Next, we define a window into which we can put this empty box::

            self.main_window = toga.MainWindow(title=self.formal_name)

This creates an instance of a ``toga.MainWindow``, which will have a title
matching the application's name. A Main Window is a special kind of window in
Toga - it's a window that is closely bound to the life cycle of the app. When
the Main Window is closed, the application exits. The Main Window is also the
window that has the application's menu (if you're on a platform like Windows
where menu bars are part of the window).

.. admonition:: Where is my window?

    If you have made an error in your code, the main window of the app may not display.
    If this happens, you can type **Ctrl+C** in the terminal where you started the app.
    This will stop the app. You can then fix the error and restart the app.

We then add our empty box as the content of the main window, and instruct the
application to show our window::

            self.main_window.content = main_box
            self.main_window.show()

Last of all, we define a ``main()`` function. This is what creates the instance
of our application::

    def main():
        return HelloWorld()

This ``main()`` method is the one that is imported and invoked by
``__main__.py``. It creates and returns an instance of our ``HelloWorld``
application.

That's the simplest possible Toga application. Let's put some of our own
content into the application, and make the app do something interesting.

Adding some content of our own
==============================

Let's do something more interesting with our ``HelloWorld`` app.

.. note::

    When you make these changes, make sure you keep the imports at the top of the file,
    and the ``main()`` at the bottom of the file. You only need to update the
    ``HelloWorld`` class.

Modify your ``HelloWorld`` class inside ``src/helloworld/app.py`` so that it
looks like this::

    class HelloWorld(toga.App):
        def startup(self):
            main_box = toga.Box(direction=COLUMN)

            name_label = toga.Label(
                "Your name: ",
                margin=(0, 5),
            )
            self.name_input = toga.TextInput(flex=1)

            name_box = toga.Box(direction=ROW, margin=5)
            name_box.add(name_label)
            name_box.add(self.name_input)

            button = toga.Button(
                "Say Hello!",
                on_press=self.say_hello,
                margin=5,
            )

            main_box.add(name_box)
            main_box.add(button)

            self.main_window = toga.MainWindow(title=self.formal_name)
            self.main_window.content = main_box
            self.main_window.show()

        def say_hello(self, widget):
            print(f"Hello, {self.name_input.value}")


Let's look in detail at what has changed.

We're still creating a main box; however, we are now applying a style::

            main_box = toga.Box(direction=COLUMN)

Toga's built-in layout system is called "Pack". It behaves a lot like CSS. You define
objects in a hierarchy - in HTML, the objects are ``<div>``, ``<span>``, and other DOM
elements; in Toga, they're widgets and boxes. You can then assign styles to the
individual elements. In this case, we're indicating that this is a ``COLUMN`` box - that
is, it is a box that will consume all the available width, and will expand its height as
content is added, but it will try to be as short as possible.

.. note::

    For more advanced uses, Toga also supports a separate style object, which is used
    like this::

        from toga.style import Pack
        main_box = toga.Box(style=Pack(direction=COLUMN))

Next, we define a couple of widgets::

            name_label = toga.Label(
                "Your name: ",
                margin=(0, 5),
            )
            self.name_input = toga.TextInput(flex=1)

Here, we define a Label and a TextInput. Both widgets have styles associated
with them; the label will have 5px of margin on its left and right, and no
margin on the top and bottom. The TextInput is marked as being flexible - that
is, it will absorb all available space in its layout axis.

The TextInput is assigned as an instance variable of the class. This gives us
easy access to the widget instance - something that we'll use in a moment.

Next, we define a box to hold these two widgets::

            name_box = toga.Box(direction=ROW, margin=5)
            name_box.add(name_label)
            name_box.add(self.name_input)

The ``name_box`` is a box just like the main box; however, this time, it's a
``ROW`` box. That means content will be added horizontally, and it will try
to make its width as narrow as possible. The box also has some margin - 5px
on all sides.

Now we define a button::

            button = toga.Button(
                "Say Hello!",
                on_press=self.say_hello,
                margin=5,
            )

The button also has 5px of margin on all sides. We also define a *handler* -
a method to invoke when the button is pressed.

Then, we add the name box and the button to the main box::

            main_box.add(name_box)
            main_box.add(button)

This completes our layout; the rest of the startup method is as it was
previously - defining a ``MainWindow``, and assigning the main box as the window's
content::

            self.main_window = toga.MainWindow(title=self.formal_name)
            self.main_window.content = main_box
            self.main_window.show()

The last thing we need to do is define the handler for the button. A handler
can be any method, generator, or asynchronous coroutine; it accepts the widget
that generated the event as an argument, and will be invoked whenever the
button is pressed::

        def say_hello(self, widget):
            print(f"Hello, {self.name_input.value}")

The body of the method is a simple print statement - however, it will
interrogate the current value of the name input, and use that content as the
text that is printed.

Now that we've made these changes we can see what they look like by starting
the application again. As before, we'll use developer mode:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase dev

      [helloworld] Starting in dev mode...
      ===========================================================================

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase dev

      [helloworld] Starting in dev mode...
      ===========================================================================

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: doscon

      (beeware-venv) C:\...>briefcase dev

      [helloworld] Starting in dev mode...
      ===========================================================================

You'll notice that this time, it *doesn't* install dependencies. Briefcase can
detect that the application has been run before, and to save time, will only
run the application. If you add new dependencies to your app, you need to make
sure that they're installed by passing in a ``-r`` option when you run
``briefcase dev``.

This should open a GUI window:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. image:: images/macOS/tutorial-2.png
       :align: center
       :alt: Hello World Tutorial 2 window, on macOS

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. image:: images/linux/tutorial-2.png
       :align: center
       :alt: Hello World Tutorial 2 window, on Linux

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. image:: images/windows/tutorial-2.png
       :align: center
       :alt: Hello World Tutorial 2 window, on Windows

If you enter a name in the text box, and press the GUI button, you should see
output appear in the console where you started the application.

Before continuing, close the app. As with Tutorial 1, you can do this by
pressing the close button on the application window, by selecting Quit/Exit from
the application's menu, or by typing **Ctrl+C** in the terminal where you ran
``briefcase dev``.

Next steps
==========

We've now got an application that does something a little more interesting. But
it only runs on our own computer. Let's package this application for
distribution. In :doc:`Tutorial 3 <tutorial-3>`, we'll wrap our application up
as a standalone installer that we could send to a friend, a customer, or upload
to an App Store.
