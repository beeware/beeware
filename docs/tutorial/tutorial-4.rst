Tutorial 4 - Updating your application
======================================

In the last tutorial, we packaged our application as a native application. If
you're dealing with a real-world app, that isn't going to be the end of the
story - you'll likely do some testing, discover problems, and need to make some
changes. Even if your application is perfect, you'll eventually want to publish
version 2 of your application with improvements.

So - how do you update your installed app when you make code changes?

Updating application code
=========================

Our application currently prints to the console when you press the button.
However, GUI applications shouldn't really use the console for output. They
need to use dialogs to communicate with users.

Let's add a dialog box to say hello, instead of writing to the console.
Modify the ``say_hello`` callback so it looks like this::

    async def say_hello(self, widget):
        await self.main_window.dialog(
            toga.InfoDialog(
                f"Hello, {self.name_input.value}",
                "Hi there!",
            )
        )

We need to make the method ``async`` so that when we display the dialog, the rest of
the application continues to run. Don't worry about this detail too much right now -
we'll give a more detailed explanation in :doc:`Tutorial 8 <tutorial-8>`.

This directs Toga to open a modal dialog box when the button is pressed.

If you run ``briefcase dev``, enter a name, and press the button, you'll see the
new dialog box:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. image:: images/macOS/tutorial-4.png
       :align: center
       :alt: Hello World Tutorial 4 dialog, on macOS

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. image:: images/linux/tutorial-4.png
       :align: center
       :alt: Hello World Tutorial 4 dialog, on Linux

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. image:: images/windows/tutorial-4.png
       :align: center
       :alt: Hello World Tutorial 4 dialog, on Windows

However, if you run ``briefcase run``, the dialog box won't appear.

Why is this? Well, ``briefcase dev`` operates by running your code in place -
it tries to produce as realistic runtime environment for your code as possible,
but it doesn't provide or use any of the platform infrastructure for wrapping
your code as an application. Part of the process of packaging your app involves
copying your code *into* the application bundle - and at the moment, your
application still has the old code in it.

So - we need to tell briefcase to update your app, copying in the new version of
the code. We *could* do this by deleting the old platform directory and starting
from scratch. However, Briefcase provides an easier way - you can update the
code for your existing bundled application:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase update

      [helloworld] Updating application code...
      Installing src/helloworld... done

      [helloworld] Removing unneeded app content...
      Removing unneeded app bundle content... done

      [helloworld] Application updated.

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase update

      [helloworld] Finalizing application configuration...
      Targeting ubuntu:jammy (Vendor base debian)
      Determining glibc version... done
      Targeting glibc 2.35
      Targeting Python3.10

      [helloworld] Updating application code...
      Installing src/helloworld... done

      [helloworld] Removing unneeded app content...
      Removing unneeded app bundle content... done


      [helloworld] Application updated.

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: doscon

      (beeware-venv) C:\...>briefcase update

      [helloworld] Updating application code...
      Installing src/helloworld... done

      [helloworld] Removing unneeded app content...
      Removing unneeded app bundle content... done

      [helloworld] Application updated.

If Briefcase can't find the scaffolded template, it will automatically invoke
``create`` to generate a fresh scaffold.

Now that we've updated the installer code, we can then run ``briefcase build``
to re-compile the app, ``briefcase run`` to run the updated app, and ``briefcase
package`` to repackage the application for distribution.

(macOS users, remember that as noted in :doc:`Tutorial 3 <tutorial-3>`, for the
tutorial we recommend running ``briefcase package`` with the ``--adhoc-sign`` flag
to avoid the complexity of setting up a code signing identity and keep the
tutorial as simple as possible.)

Update and run in one step
==========================

If you're rapidly iterating code changes, you'll likely want to make a code
change, update the application, and immediately re-run your application. For
most purposes, developer mode (``briefcase dev``) will be the easiest way to do
this sort of rapid iteration; however, if you're testing something about how
your application runs as a native binary, or hunting a bug that only manifests
when your application is in packaged form, you may need to use repeated calls to
``briefcase run``. To simplify the process of updating and running the bundled
app, Briefcase has a shortcut to support this usage pattern - the ``-u`` (or
``--update``) option on the ``run`` command.

Let's try making another change. You may have noticed that if you don't type
a name in the text input box, the dialog will say "Hello, ". Let's modify the
``say_hello`` function again to handle this edge case.

At the top of the file, between the imports and the ``class HelloWorld``
definition, add a utility method to generate an appropriate greeting depending
on the value of the name that has been provided::

    def greeting(name):
        if name:
            return f"Hello, {name}"
        else:
            return "Hello, stranger"

Then, modify the ``say_hello`` callback to use this new utility method::

        async def say_hello(self, widget):
            await self.main_window.dialog(
                toga.InfoDialog(
                    greeting(self.name_input.value),
                    "Hi there!",
                )
            )

Run your app in development mode (with ``briefcase dev``) to confirm that the
new logic works; then update, build and run the app with one command:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase run -u

      [helloworld] Updating application code...
      Installing src/helloworld... done

      [helloworld] Removing unneeded app content...
      Removing unneeded app bundle content... done

      [helloworld] Application updated.

      [helloworld] Building application...
      ...

      [helloworld] Built build/helloworld/macos/app/Hello World.app

      [helloworld] Starting app...

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase run -u

      [helloworld] Finalizing application configuration...
      Targeting ubuntu:jammy (Vendor base debian)
      Determining glibc version... done
      Targeting glibc 2.35
      Targeting Python3.10

      [helloworld] Updating application code...
      Installing src/helloworld... done

      [helloworld] Removing unneeded app content...
      Removing unneeded app bundle content... done

      [helloworld] Application updated.

      [helloworld] Building application...
      ...

      [helloworld] Built build/helloworld/linux/ubuntu/jammy/helloworld-0.0.1/usr/bin/helloworld

      [helloworld] Starting app...

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: doscon

      (beeware-venv) C:\...>briefcase run -u

      [helloworld] Updating application code...
      Installing src/helloworld... done

      [helloworld] Removing unneeded app content...
      Removing unneeded app bundle content... done

      [helloworld] Application updated.

      [helloworld] Starting app...

The package command also accepts the ``-u`` argument, so if you make a change
to your application code and want to repackage immediately, you can run
``briefcase package -u``.

Next steps
==========

We now have our application packaged for distribution on desktop platforms,
and we've been able to update the code in our application.

But what about mobile? In :doc:`Tutorial 5 <tutorial-5/index>`, we'll convert
our application into a mobile application, and deploy it onto a device
simulator, and onto a phone.
