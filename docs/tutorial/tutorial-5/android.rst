Tutorial 5 - Taking it mobile: Android
======================================

Now, we're going to take our application, and deploy it as an Android
application.

The process of deploying an application to Android is very similar to the
process for deploying as a desktop application. Briefcase handles installing
dependencies for Android, including the Android SDK, the Android emulator, and
a Java compiler.

Create an Android app and compile it
====================================

First, run the ``create`` command. This downloads an Android app template and
adds your Python code to it.

When you run ``briefcase create android`` for the first time, Briefcase
downloads a Java JDK, and the Android SDK. File sizes and download times can be
considerable; this may take a while (10 minutes or longer, depending on the
speed of your Internet connection). When the download has completed, you will be
prompted to accept Google's Android SDK license. There's a number of licenses
you'll need to agree too - keep entering ``y`` at the prompt to review and
accept each of the necessary the license agreements.

Once this completes, we'll have a ``build\helloworld\android\gradle`` directory
in our project, which will contain an Android project with a Gradle build
configuration. This project will contain your application code, and a support
package containing the Python interpreter.

We can then use Briefcase's ``build`` command to compile this into an Android
APK app file.

.. admonition:: Gradle may look stuck

  During the ``briefcase build android`` step, Gradle (the Android platform
  build tool) will print ``CONFIGURING: 100%``, and appear to be doing nothing.
  Don't worry, it's not stuck - it's downloading more Android SDK components.
  Depending on your Internet connection speed, this may take another 10 minutes
  (or longer). This lag should only happen the very first time you run
  ``build``; the tools are cached, and on your next build, the cached versions
  will be used.

Run the app on a virtual device
===============================

We're now ready to run our application. You can use Briefcase's ``run`` command
to run the app on an Android device. Let's start by running on an Android
emulator.

To run your application, run ``briefcase run android``. When you do this,
you'll be prompted with a list of devices that you could run the app on. The
last item will always be an option to create a new Android emulator.

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase run android

      Select device:

        1) Create a new Android emulator

      >

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase run android

      Select device:

        1) Create a new Android emulator

      >

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: doscon

      (beeware-venv) C:\...>briefcase run android

      Select device:

        1) Create a new Android emulator

      >

We can now choose our desired device. Select the "Create a new Android
emulator" option, and accept the default choice for the device name
(``beePhone``).

Briefcase ``run`` will automatically boot the virtual device. When the device
is booting, you will see the Android logo:

.. figure:: ../images/android/tutorial-5-booting.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30%
   :alt: Android virtual device booting

Once the device has finished booting, Briefcase will install your app on the
device. You will briefly see a launcher screen:

.. figure:: ../images/android/tutorial-5-running.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30%
   :alt: Android virtual device fully started, on the launcher screen

The app will then start. You'll see a splash screen while the app starts up:

.. figure:: ../images/android/tutorial-5-splash.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30%
   :alt: App splash screen

   App splash screen

.. admonition:: The emulator didn't start!

    The Android emulator is a complex piece of software that relies on a number
    of hardware and operating system features - features that may not be
    available or enabled on older machines. If you experience any difficulties
    starting the Android emulator, consult the `Requirements and recommendations
    <https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator#requirements>`__ section
    of the Android developer documentation.

The first time the app starts, it needs to unpack itself onto the device. This
may take a few seconds. Once it's unpacked, you'll see the Android version of
our desktop app:

.. figure:: ../images/android/tutorial-5-launched.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30%
   :alt: App from Tutorial 2, fully launched

   Demo app fully launched

If you fail to see your app launching, you may need to check your terminal
where you ran ``briefcase run`` and look for any error messages.

While the app is running, you'll see a lot of messages being streamed in
the console. This is a stream of the application's logs from the emulator.
Typing Ctrl+C into the terminal will halt the streamed information in
the console, but it will not close the emulator. This is so you can test
new changes without restarting the emulator.

In future, if you want to run on this device without using the menu, you can
provide the emulator's name to Briefcase, using ``briefcase run android -d
"@beePhone"`` to run on the virtual device directly.

Run the app on a physical device
================================

If you have a physical Android phone or tablet, you can connect it to your
computer with a USB cable, and then use the Briefcase to target your physical
device.

Android requires that you prepare your device before it can be used for
development. You will need to make 2 changes to the options on your device:

 * Enable developer options
 * Enable USB debugging

Details on how to make these changes can be found `in the Android developer
documentation <https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable>`__.

Once these steps have been completed, your device should appear in the list of
available devices when you run ``briefcase run android``.

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase run android

      Select device:

        1) Pixel 3a (94ZZY0LNE8)
        2) @beePhone (emulator)
        3) Create a new Android emulator

      >

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase run android

      Select device:

        1) Pixel 3a (94ZZY0LNE8)
        2) @beePhone (emulator)
        3) Create a new Android emulator

      >

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: doscon

      (beeware-venv) C:\...>briefcase run android

      Select device:

        1) Pixel 3a (94ZZY0LNE8)
        2) @beePhone (emulator)
        3) Create a new Android emulator

      >

Here we can see a new physical device with it's serial number on the deployment
list - in this case, a Pixel 3a. In the future, if you want to run on this
device without using the menu, you can provide the phone's serial number to
Briefcase (in this case, ``briefcase run android -d 94ZZY0LNE8``). This will run
on the device directly, without prompting.

.. admonition:: My device doesn't appear!

    If your device doesn't appear on this list at all, either you haven't enabled
    USB debugging, (or the device isn't plugged in!).

    If your device appears, but is listed as "Unknown device (not authorized for
    development)", developer mode hasn't been correctly enabled. Re-run `the
    steps to enable developer options
    <https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable>`__, and
    re-run ``briefcase run android``.

We've now got an application on our phone! Is there anywhere else we can deploy
a BeeWare app? Turn to :doc:`Tutorial 6 <../tutorial-6>` to find out...
